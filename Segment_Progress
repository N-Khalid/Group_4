## First Segment Deliverable

For the first segment of the final project, we created an initial presentation that details the main focus of our project, and our plans to work with the data. We also listed the main questions that we would like to answer as we work through the dataset. The README was updated with this draft, as seen below:

For our initial GitHub setup, we created four branches for each of the team members, and assigned our roles. The branches were named with the respective roles to create a space for each team member's work.

## Second Segment Deliverable 

As we continued to work on the project, the machine learning model and database integration were further developed. The GitHub branches were updated by each respective team meber,and production-ready code was pulled into the main branch. The presentation was also drafted, where we have detailed our thought process to provide insight to our model choice and analysis.
