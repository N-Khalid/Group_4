##  Reason we selected the topic

We want to investigate how different home features affect the price of a home in Ames, Iowa. The main features we would like to analyze would be:
  - number of bedrooms and bathrooms
  - year built
  - square footage 
  - if the home has heating/central air
  - if the home has a garage, and how many cars can fit in it

## Questions we hope to answer with the data

  - Based on key home features, how accurately can we predict the cost of a home?
  - Which feature affects the cost the most? What feature affects the cost the least?
  
## First Segment Deliverable

For the first segment of the final project, we created an initial presentation that details the main focus of our project, and our plans to work with the data. We also listed the main questions that we would like to answer as we work through the dataset. The README was updated with this draft, as seen below:

For our initial GitHub setup, we created four branches for each of the team members, and assigned our roles. The branches were named with the respective roles to create a space for each team member's work.
