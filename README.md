## First Segment Deliverable

For the first segment of the final project, we created an initial presentation that details the main focus of our project, and our plans to work with the data. We also listed the main questions that we would like to answer as we work through the datset. The README was updated with this draft, as seen below:

For our initial GitHub setup, we created four branches for each of the team members, and assigned our roles. The branches were named with the respective roles to create a space for each team member's work.
